I graduated from Saint Petersburg State University, Russia. My qualification
is "Russian language and literature teacher. Russian as a foreign language
instructor". I also have a PhD degree in sociolinguistics.

From 2000 to 2010 I worked as a researcher and Russian language instructor in
St. Petersburg (Russia). I have a lot of experience in teaching students at
different levels in Russian.

Since 2013 I've worked as a Russian language instructor for children and
adults in association [“Glad i læring”](https://www.facebook.com/Russiskskole)
in Trondheim. In addition to that I work as a private teacher.
